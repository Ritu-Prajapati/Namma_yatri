Data Source and Objectives: The dataset from the open platform allowed for seamless data analysis, focusing on fundamental questions to understand app performance and user behavior. My basic analysis included:<br />

➡️check dublicate value in tripid <br />
➡️total trips<br />
➡️total searches <br />
➡️total no. drivers <br />
➡️total earnings from the trips <br />
➡️total completed trips <br />
➡️total searches <br />
➡️total searches _got_estimate<br />
➡️ total searches_for_quotes <br />
➡️ total searches_got_quotes <br />
➡️ total drivers cancelled <br />

Insights from basic analysis: <br />
**User Journey Drop-off:** Only 81% of searches (first step) advanced to the second stage, where users received fare estimates. This raised questions about the 19% drop-off—why these users didn’t proceed. Hypotheses include issues with network speed or app response time that could cause delays in fare calculations, potentially frustrating users. <br />
**Further Drop-off in Quotes:** From the fare estimate stage, 83% of users continued to the quote stage. This led to another area of inquiry: what factors might be contributing to user disengagement at this stage? <br />
**Completion Rate Insight:** From the initial search to ride completion, only 45% of searches ended in completed rides, leaving 55% of users who didn’t complete rides. This raised questions about reasons for cancellation or drop-off, potentially influenced by factors like pricing, wait times, or external conditions. <br />

Other analysis: <br />
➡️Analyzed payment methods to identify the most frequently used options. <br />
➡️Determined the two locations with the highest number of trips. <br />
➡️Investigated which areas had the highest trip counts over various durations. <br />
➡️lculated conversion rates and booking cancellation rates to assess app performance. <br />
➡️Evaluated quote acceptance rates and estimates-to-search ratios for quotes. <br />
➡️Analyzed trip distribution by duration and fares to identify revenue-generating periods. <br />
➡️Mapped areas with the highest fares and cancellation rates. <br />
➡️Identified the driver-customer pairs with the highest order frequency. <br />
